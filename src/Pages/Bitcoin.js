              <p> Created by an individual or a group of individuals identified by the pseudonym 
                “Satoshi Nakamoto”, Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency. It was launched 
                in 2009 and is based on the technology -- blockchain. Bitcoin is essentially a 
                digital currency that works on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. 
                The network isn’t controlled by any central authority or banking institution and Bitcoin transactions 
                are completely transparent. The number of Bitcoins that can ever exist is limited to 21 million. 
                New Bitcoins are created through a process called ‘mining’ which involves the use of computing power
                 to approve transactions in the Bitcoin network. The cryptocurrency can either be mined or purchased 
                 from a cryptocurrency exchange. </p>
